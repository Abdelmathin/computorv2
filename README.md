    This project aims to make you code a simple equation solving program. It will take polynomial equations into account. These equations will only require exponents. No complex
    function. The program will have to display its solution(s).
    Why polynomials? Just because it’s one of the simplest and most powerful tools in
    mathematics. It is used in every field on every level to simplify and express many things.
    For instance, they help calculate functions such as sin, cos, et tan.

## Objectives:

- The idea is to get you (back) in touch with the manipulation of elementary mathematic
    tools you will be able to use in seveal 42 subjects. The idea is not to "just make maths".
    This exercise will allow you to approach exercises that will require these skills and knowledge with a restful mind.
- Besides, this small subject will be completed with others, touching various subjects
    that will help you understand what you do, rather than just copy a formula you’ve found
    on the Internet.

```bash
pip install computorv2
```

# Derivative:

- To differentiate
$$ P(x) = a . x^n + b $$
where a, x, n, b are all functions of x, we use the product rule, the chain rule, and the general power rule.

```math
$ \begin{bmatrix}
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\
c_1 & c_2 & c_3 
\end{bmatrix}  $
```

<!-- $$  P(x) = a . x^n + b $$

$$  \frac{d P(x)}{d x} = \frac{d a}{d x} . x^n + a . \frac{d x^n}{d x} + \frac{d b}{d x} $$
$$ \frac{d x^n}{d x} = $$ -->
