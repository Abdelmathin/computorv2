## Objectives:

- Enable users to assign polynomial expressions, allowing for the representation of mathematical equations.

- Facilitate the assignment of functions, including the ability to incorporate trigonometric and logarithmic functions with complex numbers.

- Implement functionality to calculate the derivative of assigned functions, enabling users to analyze rates of change and function behavior.

- Allow for the assignment of matrices, providing a structured way to represent and manipulate data.

- Support matrix operations, such as multiplication, enabling users to perform linear algebra calculations seamlessly.

- Enable the assignment of complex numbers, allowing for calculations that involve real and imaginary components.

- Facilitate operations with complex numbers, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations and combinations with other numerical types.

- Create a tool that integrates mathematical functions and is capable of performing operations with variables of different types.

- Implement functionality to compute derivatives of functions, allowing for the analysis of rates of change and other calculus-related operations.

- Allow users to compute higher-order derivatives, facilitating deeper exploration of function behavior and characteristics.

```bash
pip install computorv2
```

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `make` and a compatible compiler (like `gcc` or `clang`) installed on your system.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Abdelmathin/computorv2.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
```bash
cd computorv2
```

3. **Build the Project:**
```bash
make
```

## Usage:

To run the shell, execute the following command:

```bash
./computor
```

### Examples

Hereâ€™s a simple examples of how to use the shell:

1. **Assign a polynomial:**

	In this example, a polynomial p is assigned, which is a quadratic function. The coefficients 2, 3, and 5 represent the constants for x <sup>2</sup>, x, and the constant term, respectively.

	This polynomial can be used for further calculations, evaluations, and derivative computations.

```bash
p = 2*x^2 + 3*x + 5
```

2. **Assign a function:**

Here, a function g(x) is defined, which combines a trigonometric function, the sine of x, multiplied by x, and the natural logarithm of x + 2i.

This showcases the shell's ability to handle both real and complex functions, providing a powerful tool for mathematical analysis.

```bash
g(x) = sin(x) * x - ln(x + 2i)
```

3. **Calculate the derivative:**

In this step, a new function f(x) is created by adding the sine function to the derivative of g(x).

This demonstrates the shell's capability to compute derivatives and use them in subsequent functions, allowing for complex mathematical manipulations.

```bash
f(x) = sin(x) + g'(x)
```

4. **Assign a matrix:**

A matrix M is defined, which is a 2x2 array containing integers.

This matrix can be used for various operations, such as transformations, multiplications, and more complex linear algebra tasks.

```bash
M = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

5. **Perform a matrix operation:**

Here, the matrix M is multiplied by itself.

The shell computes the resulting matrix, demonstrating its ability to handle matrix operations effectively.

The result will yield a new matrix, which can be used for further calculations or analyses.

```bash
result = M * M
```

6. **Assign a complex number:**

A complex number c is assigned, which consists of a real part (3) and an imaginary part (4).

This example showcases the shell's support for complex number calculations, essential for many mathematical applications, particularly in engineering and physics.

```bash
c = 3 + 4i
```

7. **Perform operations with the complex number:**

In this example, the previously assigned complex number c is added to another complex number 1 + 2i. The shell computes the sum, resulting in a new complex number that combines both real and imaginary parts. This illustrates how users can perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers, enhancing the versatility of the tool.

```bash
result = c + (1 + 2i)
```

8. **Evaluate a polynomial at a specific value:**

The polynomial p is evaluated at x = 2. The shell computes the result, providing insights into the behavior of the polynomial at that specific point.

```bash
value = p(2)
```

# Derivative:

- To differentiate
$$ P(x) = a . x^n + b $$
where a, x, n, b are all functions of x, we use the product rule, the chain rule, and the general power rule.



$$
\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
--->

<!-- $$  P(x) = a . x^n + b $$

$$  \frac{d P(x)}{d x} = \frac{d a}{d x} . x^n + a . \frac{d x^n}{d x} + \frac{d b}{d x} $$
$$ \frac{d x^n}{d x} = $$ -->
